In this study, the factors affecting student exam success were examined with Python and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) machine learning algorithm using the Kaggle data set. Student success data obtained from the Kaggle data set was used. The data set includes various factors such as demographic information and study habits, along with students' exam results. The data was read and preprocessed using the Python programming language. Then, the KNN algorithm was used to determine the factors affecting student exam success.
